            <h3> Context </h3>
  <p> This is my blog 6. Throughout this school year, we had a project called the Freedom Project. This is our year-long project, and we have reached the end. Where we had to pick a tool and learn how it use it. We are getting to the final parts of the project. We have coded an MVP up to this point, which is like a start to our project. So I finished my MVP during the break for this cooking game I was doing. I made some changes to the initial project. So the tool that I picked was Kaboom JS, and in some ways, I learned this was by using <a href="https://kaboomjs.com/">tool</a>. On this website, you are allowed to see the codes you can use, and you can go to the playground, which has games and codes for those games. Another thing I used was the learning-log.md, where I put all the information I learned. So wondering what I did for the freedom project. We had to make an elevator pitch and slides for our project. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-lgzP7K8CmKBgsjgY4cMFvLfvLTIZefJRRvoIbQveG4/edit?tab=t.0">elevator pitch</a> and the <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1I7DhBuQJP0BuV2XR532SJXRRB0XofwneNnzXnazd_aU/edit?slide=id.p#slide=id.p">google slides</a>. </p>

          <h3> Challenges </h3>
<p> One challenge I had was the sprites not loading; we were missing a " in the code, so the sprite wouldn't load. So we asked Ellen and Kyle for help, and they helped us with it.  </p>
<p> Texts merging, we people were giving back feedback for the MVP of our freedom project, everyone was saying how the texts were being merged, so that is one thing we had to fix.   </p>
<p> Communicate, I was working with someone and it is key to talk when you are working with someone, but we didn't, which was challenging as it was hard to know who was doing what and when we doing it. So these were the challenges</p>
            <h3> Takeaways from the elevator pitch</h3>

<p> One takeaway is that I should make more eye contact. In my opinion, I feel like I didn't look around enough. I feel that when I was talking to the teachers, I was just looking at my computer, which isn't good because I don't know what people were thinking when I was presenting, and I wouldn't know if they could hear me. This is the first takeaway.  </p>
<p> The last takeaway was that you should be prepared before the pitch. If we weren't ready, we wouldn't know who is doing what and what part is whose. This is something I was making sure we do before we present. Which made it go smoothly. These are the takeaways for the class pitch, and there were takeaways for the class presentation. We know who was doing which part of it, so when we were talking, it went well. This is what we learned.</p>

            <h3> Takeaways from in-class presentation  </h3>
<p> One takeaway from the class presentation  is that I should spend some time thinking of a hook. I lost points because my hook wasn't the best, so I should have spent more time on my hook and made it interesting.  </p>
<p> Another takeaway is that I should make more eye contact. In my opinion, I feel like I didn't look around enough. I feel that when I was talking, I was just looking at my computer, which isn't good because I don't know what people were thinking when I was presenting, and I wouldn't know if they could hear me. </p>
<p> 
The last takeaway was that you should be prepared before presenting in class. If we weren't ready, we wouldn't know who is doing what and what part is whose. This is something I was making sure we do before we present. Which made it go smoothly. Therefore, we know what to do next time, and these are my takeaways. Now we learned for next time.</p>
          
<h3> Reflection </h3>

<p>Make sure you have friends who can help, like when we needed help. We were able to ask a friend, so having friends is very important.</p>
<p> Communication is key. When you are having trouble, it is always good to have someone, and when you are partners, you need to talk to each other, or the work won't turn out the way you want it to go. These are the reflections we learned this year.</p>
